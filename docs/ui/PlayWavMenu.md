# Galaxino UI

## Play Wav

Once you have selected this menu option you will be taken to the file browser. Navigate through the files to select a Wav file you wish to load and then use the **Button** action to select that file.

Directories can be selected in the same manner, use the previous directory ".." to go up one level.

WAV files with names longer than the LCD display width will scroll after a short pause. The scroll rate can be changed in the [Settings Menu](/docs/ui/SettingsMenu.md).

Once you have selected a GTP file, the file will be verified and on success the load will start.
